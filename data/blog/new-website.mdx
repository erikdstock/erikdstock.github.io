## I'm building a new website.

I felt like it was time to relaunch my personal website. For all the time I spent getting certain elements of the [static site configuration][next-ts-starter] right, the design side never fully clicked. Writing into an ugly blog never felt rewarding.

So welcome to my 2022 weblog. It's built on a similar base: A [next.js][nextjs] static site with [typescript][typescript], markdown and mdx support (plus a bunch of plugins i didn't have to bother learning about), but I dropped my previous css-in-jsx approach for plain css with [tailwind.css](https://tailwindcss.com). I've enjoyed similar frameworks in the past, found them messy at times but want to give it another try. It's nice to see them already configured into a coherent, responsive site and I'm hoping to make some deeper style changes once the things is up and running. You can copy the repo yourself following some version of the instructions [here][repo].

The kinds of things I intend to write about:

- Software development, and my own triumphs and failures as an engineer
- Learning, education and how they intersect with technology
- Witty observations that are too good (funny/original/deep) to share on twitter or other social media
- Little tips and tricks to help you navigate life
- My evolution as a crank and a curmudgeon no longer in the 'cool' generation
- The state of the technology business today, its crimes and and its hubris

If this website looks like it's still in draft, congratulations! You have been granted early access to a beta build of **Erik Online**. We hope to reach 1.0 by mid-2023.
