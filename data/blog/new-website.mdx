# New website

I felt like it was time to relaunch my personal website. For all the time I spent getting certain elements of the static site configuration right, the design side never fully clicked. Writing into an ugly blog never felt rewarding.

So welcome to my 2022 weblog. It's built on a similar base: A next.js static site with typescript and markdown and mdx support, but I dropped my previous css-in-jsx approach for plain css with [tailwind.css](https://tailwindcss.com). I've enjoyed similar frameworks in the past, found them messy at times but want to give them another try. It's nice to see them already configured into a coherent, responsive site and I'm hoping to make some deeper style changes once the things is up and running.
