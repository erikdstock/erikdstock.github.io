> 2022 update: When I set up a new M1 Mac work machine homebrew recommended I load it in [my `~/.zprofile`](https://github.com/erikdstock/dotfiles/blob/c0688bcbe49b27c20ca1310505486120a992a957/homedir/zprofile). This complicates the takeaways I give below, but I guess the main update would be that tools you need only for interactive sheels can go in there. My dotfiles need an overhaul.

MacOS 10.15 (Catalina) changed the default shell from `bash` to `zsh`, which
encouraged me to finally figure out what the heck is going on when I log in and
why my dotfiles always feel like such a mess. This includes both the strange
loading logic (of `bash` in particular) as well as the quirks that Apple's macOS
adds to the mix. It turns out that it's not that bad. (Note: for all purposes
here I am only talking about shells loaded via a [GUI] Terminal app)

## Default shell startup script loading order

The charts below are copied from a
[2008 blog post](https://shreevatsa.wordpress.com/2008/03/30/zshbash-startup-files-loading-order-bashrc-zshrc-etc/)
that stands the test of time.

They illustrate how a given shell environment selects which scripts to execute
on startup, beginning from the top of a given column and continuing through each
script marked with a letter in alphabetical order- but only the _first_ file
found for each letter. The columns account for varying strategies depending on
whether the shell is being created for a script or for an interactive shell and,
in the later case, whether the interactive shell is a login shell.

In Unix terms, a _login shell_ is the shell used at startup - for example, the
shell which starts the X Window server or otherwise starts the system such as
via ssh or when logging in through a tty terminal (not sure why we still pretend
these things exist).

The key caveat on these charts for Mac users is explained
[here](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/119711/why-doesnt-mac-os-x-source-bashrc):
On macOS, launching a new terminal or terminal tab is treated as a login shell.
Regardless of your OS, once you are _in the terminal_ subshells (like running
`bash`) are _not_ login shells.

**As a result, most Linux users should read down the second column for their
shell, while most Mac users would read down the first.**

### `bash` startup scripts

Bash's startup script strategy is especially complicated for Mac users:

- For an interactive non-login shell (that is, linux), `~/.bashrc` is executed
  and the main point for user customization
- For macOS's interactive non-login shell (even in terminal.app), `~/.bashrc` is
  ignored in favor of the _first_ file found of `~/.bash_profile`,
  `~/.bash_login` and `~/.profile` (below, only the _first_ of _B1, B2, or B3_).

**To simplify this, the common advice has been to add '`source ~/.bashrc`' to
your `~/.bash_profile` (the first of the optional login scripts) and keep
customizations in `~/.bashrc`.**

|                    | Interactive login | Interactive non-login | Script |
| ------------------ | ----------------- | --------------------- | ------ |
| `/etc/profile`     | A                 |                       |        |
| `/etc/bash.bashrc` |                   | A                     |        |
| `~/.bashrc`        |                   | B                     |        |
| `~/.bash_profile`  | B1                |                       |        |
| `~/.bash_login`    | B2                |                       |        |
| `~/.profile`       | B3                |                       |        |
| `source $BASH_ENV` |                   |                       | A      |
| _logout only:_     |                   |                       |        |
| `~/.bash_logout`   | C                 |                       |        |

### `zsh` startup scripts

`zsh` is straightforward by comparison. It is still a login shell on mac, though
most folks only bother with `.zshrc` and there are no strange loading quirks.

Most folks I know use only `.zshrc` and/or [Oh my zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) to
manage their `zsh`.

|                 | Interactive login | Interactive non-login | Script |
| --------------- | ----------------- | --------------------- | ------ |
| `/etc/zshenv`   | A                 | A                     | A      |
| `~/.zshenv`     | B                 | B                     | B      |
| `/etc/zprofile` | C                 |                       |        |
| `~/.zprofile`   | D                 |                       |        |
| `/etc/zshrc`    | E                 | C                     |        |
| `~/.zshrc`      | F                 | D                     |        |
| `/etc/zlogin`   | G                 |                       |        |
| `~/.zlogin`     | H                 |                       |        |
| _logout only:_  |                   |                       |        |
| `~/.zlogout`    | I                 |                       |        |
| `/etc/zlogout`  | J                 |                       |        |

## Key Takeaways

- Mac shells start out as login shells. This makes `bash`'s startup script
  loading order more complicated.
- Put your `bash` customizations in `~/.bashrc` and source it from
  `~/.bash_profile` to avoid this issue.
- Put your `zsh` customizations in `~/.zshrc`.
- On a Mac, you can print any welcome or diagnostic messages from
  `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.zlogin`.
