A difference in how ruby and node.js treat backticks presents a tempting pitfall for developers writing ruby tests.

> TL;DR: If you need to preserve line breaks in a ruby string, use a squiggly `<<~HEREDOC.strip`. If you are trying to test around annoying line breaks in Rails, try `String#squish`.

Developers working in the Node.js/ECMAScript universe are familiar with the language's [template string literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals). One feature that has made them so popular, even when string interpolation is not needed, is the ability to preserve line breaks:

```ts
const result = 'Your order\nis ready'
const expected = `You're order
is ready`

result.includes(expected)
// => false
```

In ruby however, [backticks are a shorthand for running a script](https://ruby-doc.org/3.1.3/Kernel.html#method-i-60) in a shell and returning its output to STDOUT as a string:

```rb
my_files = `ls ~`
# => "Applications\nDesktop\nDocuments\nDownloads\n ...
```

If the script errors, the backticked method exits and returns `nil`, but adding a line break
obscures this behavior, returning an empty string (nothing was sent to STDOUT) instead:

```rb
x = `Your order`
# Errno::ENOENT: No such file or directory - Your
x
# => nil

expected = `Your order
is ready`
# sh: Your: command not found
# sh: line 1: is: command not found
# => ""
```

If you are accustomed to using this backticked behavior to test strings with line breaks, these
quirks can combine to hide false positives in tests:

```rb
expected = `Your order
is ready`

"You're order\nis ready".include?(expected)
# => true
```

## Testing multiline strings in ruby

Ruby's (uglier, more awkward) method for a case like this is to use its [HEREDOC format](https://www.rubyguides.com/2018/11/ruby-heredoc/):

```rb
expected = <<~HERE
  Your order
  is ready
HERE
# => "Your order\nis ready\n"

# Again without the final newline:
expected = <<~HERE.strip
  Your order
  is ready
HERE
# => "Your order\nis ready"

# Finally our test is working
"You're order\nis ready".include?(expected)
# => false
```

Depending on your testing needs, there are other ways to get around this. In rails for example
[String#squish](https://apidock.com/rails/String/squish) will convert all successive whitespaces in a string to a single space.

```rb
actual = "Your order\nis ready"
expected = "Your order is ready"

test_subject = actual.squish

test_subject.include?(expected)
# => true
```
